;;
;;  Generated package (no.60) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.
;;
;;; Code:

;;(package! rime)
;; (use-package rime
;;   :custom
;;   (default-input-method "rime")
;;   (rime-user-data-dir "~/.config/input_method/rime")
;;   (rime-disable-predicates
;;    '(meow-normal-mode-p
;;      meow-motion-mode-p
;;      meow-keypad-mode-p
;;      meow-beacon-mode-p
;;      ))
