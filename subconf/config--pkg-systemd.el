;;
;;  Generated package (no.57) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.
;;
;;; Code:

;; (package! systemd :pin "b6ae63a236605b1c5e1069f7d3afe06ae32a7bae")
;; (use-package! systemd
;;   :defer t)

(provide 'config--pkg-systemd)
;;; config--pkg-systemd.el ends here
