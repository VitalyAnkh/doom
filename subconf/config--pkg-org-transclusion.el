;;
;;  Generated package (no.91) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.
;;
;;  Package statement:

;;; Code:


(use-package! org-transclusion

  :init
  (map! :after org :map org-mode-map
        "<f12>" #'org-transclusion-mode))
