;;
;;  Generated package (no.70) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.
;;
;;; Code:

(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append
       '(("\\.agda\\'" . agda2-mode)
         ("\\.lagda.md\\'" . agda2-mode))
       auto-mode-alist))

(provide 'config-agda)
;;; config-agda.el ends here
