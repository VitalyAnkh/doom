;;
;;  Generated package (no.89) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.
;;
;;  Package statement:
;;   (package! ob-http)
;;
;;; Code:

(use-package! ob-http
  :commands org-babel-execute:http)

(provide 'config--pkg-ob-http)
;;; config--pkg-ob-http.el ends here
