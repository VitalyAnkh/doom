;;
;;  Generated package (no.10) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.

;;; Code:

(setq frame-title-format
      '(""
        (:eval
         (if (string-match-p (regexp-quote (or (bound-and-true-p org-roam-directory) "\u0000"))
                             (or buffer-file-name ""))
             (replace-regexp-in-string
              ".*/[0-9]*-?" "☰ "
              (subst-char-in-string ?_ ?\s buffer-file-name))
           "%b"))
        (:eval
