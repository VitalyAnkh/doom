;;
;;  Generated package (no.85) from my config.
;;
;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of
;;  state from other configuration blocks. Only use this if you know /exactly/
;;  what you are doing.
;;
;;  This may function nicely as a bit of self-contained functionality, or it
;;  might be a horrid mix of functionalities and state.
;;
;;  Hopefully, in future static analysis will allow this to become more
;;  properly package-like.
;;
;;  Package statement:
;;   (package! org-appear :recipe (:host github :repo "awth13/org-appear"))
;;
;;; Code:

(use-package! org-appear
  :hook (org-mode . org-appear-mode)
  :config
  (setq org-appear-autoemphasis t
        org-appear-autosubmarkers t
        org-appear-autolinks nil)
  ;; for proper first-time setup, `org-appear--set-elements'
  ;; needs to be run after other hooks have acted.
  (run-at-time nil nil #'org-appear--set-elements))

(provide 'config--pkg-org-appear)
;;; config--pkg-org-appear.el ends here
