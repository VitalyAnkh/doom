;;
;;  Generated package (no.40) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.
;;
;;  Package statement:
;;   (package! info-colors)
;;
;;; Code:


(use-package! info-colors
  :commands (info-colors-fontify-node))

(add-hook 'Info-selection-hook 'info-colors-fontify-node)

(provide 'config--pkg-info-colors)
;;; config--pkg-info-colors.el ends here
