;;
;;  Generated package (no.123) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.
;;
;;  Package statement:
;;   (package! graphviz-dot-mode)

;;; Code:


(use-package! graphviz-dot-mode
  :commands graphviz-dot-mode
  :mode ("\\.dot\\'" . graphviz-dot-mode)
  :init
  (after! org
    (setcdr (assoc "dot" org-src-lang-modes)
            'graphviz-dot)))
